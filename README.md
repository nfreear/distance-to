# Distance To …?

What is the distance to [_XX_] from my current location?

A minimalist [progressive web app][] to answer this question, designed for offline use and for when the mobile signal is poor.

* Web App: [nfreear.github.io/distance-to][ghp]
* Repo: [github.com/nfreear/distance-to][repo]

Uses [`LatLng`][geo] and [`EarthCRS`][geo] JS classes from [Leaflet.js][].
